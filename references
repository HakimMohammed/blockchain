# Descripton:
what we will do is creating a private blockchain network
Private Blockchain Newtwork : a normal blockchain network ( public ) is a tool/system to ensure confidentialtiy/security/tracability of transactions ( e.g: ETH ) , but it's still a PUBLIC network so anyone outside the netwrok will be able to access those transactions, and apply transactions themsleves. the use of a private blockchain network is like the public one with the addition of restricted access to only those who are allowed ( have an identity inside the network ) ( e.g: a company want to ensure it's stock security, it will setup a private network and only it's employees can access the blockchain).

# Provider
HyperLedger Fabric

# LEDGER: Stored Data
we will be storing two things in the blockchain
.  World State ( Current State: what do we "have" now )
.  Transaaction Log ( History: everything that happend before )
  #   this data is synced between peers ( whenever a peer updated his ledger, the other peers need to add that transaction to their ledger )
  #   for now wa9ila a big wa9ila this done by CFT ( Crash Fault Tolerance )
  
# PEER: a user in the network
a user needs to be "certified" ot get identified as a peer ( something to prove that u are who u saying u are , b7al carte nationale / passport )
.  every transaction a peer does need to be "signed" by it's certificate to be valid
.  every peer has its own copy of the LEGDER

# P2P : Peer to Peer network

# CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY
it will be the one to "certify" the peers ( make them valid/trusted users )

# SMART CONTRACT == CHAINCODE
with it we can initiate a transaction
They are the ones who update the peer's ledger

# MEMBERSHIP SERVICE PROVIDER
specifies which peers are allowed to be a part of the network and which aren't ( so getting a certificate from a CA [Certificate Authority] doesnt necessary mean u are a part of the network)
it also specefied the rules of a network
