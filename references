# Descripton:
what we will do is creating a private blockchain network
Private Blockchain Newtwork : a normal blockchain network ( public ) is a tool/system to ensure confidentialtiy/security/tracability of transactions ( e.g: ETH ) , but it's still a PUBLIC network so anyone outside the netwrok will be able to access those transactions, and apply transactions themsleves. the use of a private blockchain network is like the public one with the addition of restricted access to only those who are allowed ( have an identity inside the network ) ( e.g: a company want to ensure it's stock security, it will setup a private network and only it's employees can access the blockchain).

# Provider
HyperLedger Fabric

# Stored Data
we will be storing two things in the blockchain
.  World State ( Current State: what do we "have" now )
.  Transaaction Log ( History: everything that happend before )
